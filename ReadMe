Title   : Let the Sphere
Creator : Jae

Everything is black dark.

There is a robot ball.
When you get close to him, it wakes up.

Guide the ball to get it to the "goal" position.
There will be invisible walls.

Only way to avoid them is listening to the "sound" that robot ball makes when the wall is near by.

Good luck!
